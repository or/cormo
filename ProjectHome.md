cormo's goal is to provide an ORM in C++, which can handle various SQL backends. Currently the focus is on PostgreSQL, but MySQL and SQLite will hopefully be added in time.

Features:
  * easy and tidy modelling in Python
  * C++ templating
  * separation of ORM logic and business logic
  * no SQL in your code
  * the generated code largely conforms to the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)
